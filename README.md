# My (Obsolete) Vim Setup

I'm not using this setup anymore, but I'm keeping it around for when I need to update the plugins I maintain. In its place is my new [Neovim setup](git@github.com:PhilRunninger/nvim_config.git).

If you're interested in the last complete setup of this .vim configuration, checkout branch [before_nvim_switch](https://github.com/PhilRunninger/.vim/tree/before_nvim_switch).
