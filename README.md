# My Vim Setup

## Installation

These instructions assume you will be running them from a bash shell. First, clone the repository into your home directory. On Windows, use the folder name `vimfiles`; on all other OSes, use the folder name `.vim`.

__Windows__

```
$ git clone git@github.com:PhilRunninger/vim.git ~/vimfiles
$ vim
```
__Mac or Linux__

```
$ git clone git@github.com:PhilRunninger/vim.git ~/.vim
$ vim
```

The rest of the setup takes place in vim. Ignore the error messages when it first starts. They will go away after you run the `:PlugInstall` command and restart vim. This command is part of the [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) plugin manager, which is embedded in this repository. (You should periodically upgrade vim-plug using the `:PlugUpgrade` command.)

## Customized Post-Processing

This setup is designed for my primary development environment on a MacBook. Using this setup in different environments may require additional steps or different setting values. To facilitate this, use the `~/.vim/after/plugin` folder. Just add VimScript file there, and it will be executed after the `vimrc` file is finished being sourced. In this file, you can change settings for the particular environment.

### Example

Here is the file I use on my Windows environment, which has only 16 colors.

```vim
" vim: filetype=vim

let NERDTreeDirArrowExpandable = '►'
let NERDTreeDirArrowCollapsible = '▼'

function! Map_ff()
    return &ff
endfunction

function! Map_ro_mod()
    return (&modifiable ? (&readonly ? "ro" : "") : "RO") . (&modified ? "+" : "")
endfunction

if has("gui_win32")
  set guifont=Consolas:h12:w6
else
  colorscheme SlateDark

  highlight WildMenu    cterm=none ctermfg=0 ctermbg=3   " Black on Yellow
  highlight GitBranch   cterm=none ctermfg=7 ctermbg=1   " White on Blue
  highlight Insert      cterm=none ctermfg=15 ctermbg=1  " White on Blue
  highlight NormalMod   cterm=none ctermfg=15 ctermbg=4  " White on Red
  highlight NormalNoMod cterm=none ctermfg=15 ctermbg=2  " White on Green
endif
```

## My Favorite Plugins

I change my vimrc way more often than is reasonable. As a result, it's hard to keep my key mappings' descriptions, formerly published here, up to date. In its place, I'm just going to list my favorite plugins and reasons why I like them.

### [NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) and [nerdtree-buffer-ops](https://github.com/PhilRunninger/nerdtree-buffer-ops.git)
NERDTree is a tree explorer, this is useful for displaying your project tree in a side window. My mind grasps the tree paradigm better than others like fuzzy finders. In the spirit of full disclosure, I'm one of the collaborators of that project.

The other is a plugin for a plugin. *(Can you say "recursion"?)* One of its two capabilities lets you close an open buffer from its location in the NERDTree window. The other changes the color of a file in the NERDTree window if it's open in the vim session.

### [Fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive)
This is one that I don't use to its fullest extent. It's a very powerful in-Vim interface to Git commands. The commands I find most helpful are `:Gdiff` and `:Gblame` (usually to find out **when** a change occurred, not **who** did it.) When the mood strikes, I'll also use `:Gstatus` to review, stage, and commit changes.

### [NeoSnippet](https://github.com/Shougo/neosnippet) and [vim-snippets](https://github.com/PhilRunninger/vim-snippets)
This plugin inserts snippets of text at the current location, useful for stubbing out a new program. I have my own fork of snippets.

### [](https://github.com/w0rp/ale.git)
### [GitGutter](https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter)
This shows where I have uncommitted changes in a file. It also provides key mappings for navigating them: `]c` and `[c` to name a couple.

### [Commentary](https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary.git)
Comment or uncomment several lines of code at once. It is smart enough to know the syntax of the language.

### [](https://github.com/diepm/vim-rest-console.git)
### [Buffergator](https://github.com/jeetsukumaran/vim-buffergator.git)
Lists open buffers so that you can select one to switch to in the current, or new split, window.

### [](https://github.com/guns/xterm-color-table.vim)
### [](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox.git)
### [](https://github.com/sotte/presenting.vim.git)
### [NeoComplete](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplete.vim)
A much-improved version of Vim's autocompletion.

### [UndoTree](https://github.com/mbbill/undotree)
This plugin displays a visual history of the changes made to the active buffer. Most interestingly, it shows how Vim manages these changes as a tree, rather than the expected stack.

### [Easy-Align](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-easy-align)
I use this plugin to line up columns of text, useful for tables of data or lines of similar code.

### [Scratch](https://github.com/mtth/scratch.vim)
Need a place to jot a thought down? Put it in a scratch buffer.

### [Vim-Sessions](https://github.com/PhilRunninger/vim-sessions.git)
This plugin allows you to leave a `.session.vim` file in a folder, so that when you restart vim, you can pick up where you left off. On startup, the plugin looks for a `.session.vim` file in the current folder or anywhere up the hierarchy, and asks whether or not to use it.

### [](https://github.com/kshenoy/vim-signature)
### [](https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat)
### [Vim-Surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround)
This is a great plugin for surrounding text with delimiters: `" ' [ ] ( ) { } < >` or HTML tags.

## Custom Key Mappings

### Window Movement/Sizing Shortcuts

Mode | Mapping | Function
---|---|---
Terminal | `\w` | Replacement for `<C-W>` in a terminal window, because my leader key, `<space>`, caused annoying delays.
Normal | `<leader>w` | Shortcut for `<C-W>` because of the Macbook's awkward Control key placement.
Normal | `<C-H>` or `<leader>wh` | Go to next window to the left.
Normal | `<C-J>` or `<leader>wj` | Go to next window down.
Normal | `<C-K>` or `<leader>wk` | Go to next window up.
Normal | `<C-L>` or `<leader>wl` | Go to next window to the right.
Normal | `Up` | Resize 5 rows taller. Same as `5<C-W>+`.
Normal | `Down` | Resize 5 rows shorter. Same as `5<C-W>-`.
Normal | `Left` | Resize 10 columns narrower. Same as `10<C-W><`.
Normal | `Right` | Resize 10 columns wider. Same as `10<C-W>>`.
Normal | `<leader>x` | Maximize current window. Same as <code>\<C-W>&#124;\<C-W>_</code>.
