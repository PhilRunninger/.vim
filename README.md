# My Vim Setup

## Setup Instructions

These instructions assume you will be running them from a bash shell, whether in Windows or not. Even so, there are differences between Windows and other OSs in the way vim looks for these files.

### Windows

```
$ cd ~
$ git clone git@github.com:PhilRunninger/my_vim_setup.git vimfiles
```

### Unix and Mac

```
$ cd ~
$ git clone git@github.com:PhilRunninger/my_vim_setup.git .vim
```

### All OSes

The rest of the setup takes place in vim. Ignore the error messages when you first start vim. They will go away after you run this command.

```
:PlugInstall
```

That should do it. You can close and reopen vim to see that there are no longer any messages on startup.

## Customized vimrc Processing

This setup is designed for my primary development environment on a MacBook, with a specific font: [DroidSansMonoForPowerline NF](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/patched-fonts/DroidSansMono/complete/Droid%20Sans%20Mono%20for%20Powerline%20Nerd%20Font%20Complete%20Mono%20Windows%20Compatible.otf). Using this setup in another OS, or with a different font or different colors, will produce undesirable behavior. To alleviate this behavior, a post processing step can be used. This is done with a separate file - **post_vimrc** in the same folder as vimrc - that is sourced after vimrc. In this file, you can change settings for the particular environment.

### Example

Here is the post_vimrc I use on my Windows environment, which has fewer color and font options, and gitgutter (for now, at least) is not working correctly.

```
" vim: filetype=vim

colorscheme af

unlet g:airline_symbols

let g:gitgutter_enabled = 0

unlet NERDTreeDirArrowExpandable
unlet NERDTreeDirArrowCollapsible
unlet NERDTreeGlyphReadOnly

let g:NERDTreeIndicatorMapCustom = {
    \ "Modified"  : "M",
    \ "Staged"    : "S",
    \ "Untracked" : "?",
    \ "Renamed"   : "R",
    \ "Unmerged"  : "U",
    \ "Deleted"   : "D",
    \ "Dirty"     : "d",
    \ "Clean"     : "c",
    \ "Unknown"   : "u"
    \ }
```

## Custom Key Mappings

**Important Note:** *Make sure you type commands as you see them in rendered form. Do not type Markup's escape characters (backtick, in particular) when issuing the commands.*

The `<leader>` key is used to increase the number of possible key mappings. By default, it is the backslash key, but many Vimmers, including me, have it redefined as the spacebar, which is always within reach, and normally has no useful function anyway.

Mappings of more than one character must be fully typed within a short timeout period; otherwise, they will be considered as separate keystrokes. For example, `<leader>b` typed too slowly, would move your cursor one character to the right, and then back one word.

### Plugin Mappings

### Windowing and Movement

To create windows (splits), I use these Vim commands:

* `Ctrl+W`, `S` to split the current window horizontally
* `Ctrl+W`, `V` to split the current window vertically

Mode | Mapping | Function | Replaces This Vim Command
---|---|---|---
Normal | `Tab`         | Move to next window          | `Ctrl+W`, `W`
Normal | `Ctrl+J`      | Move to next window below    | `Ctrl+W`, `J`
Normal | `Ctrl+K`      | Move to next window above    | `Ctrl+W`, `K`
Normal | `Ctrl+H`      | Move to next window at left  | `Ctrl+W`, `H`
Normal | `Ctrl+L`      | Move to next window at right | `Ctrl+W`, `L`
Normal | `Shift+Up`    | Resize window taller         | `:resize +5<Enter>`
Normal | `Shift+Down`  | Resize window shorter        | `:resize -5<Enter>`
Normal | `Shift+Right` | Resize window wider          | `:vertical resize +10<Enter>`
Normal | `Shift+Left`  | Resize window narrower       | `:vertical resize -10<Enter>`
